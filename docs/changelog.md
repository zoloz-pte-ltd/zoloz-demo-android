## Version 1.3.3.231103135532
+ Added a new operation guide diagram in the NativeSDK scanning page for Real ID and ID Recognition. Users will be prompted to center their ID within the capture box, for both the front and back sides of the document.

## Version 1.3.2.231020100216
+ Improve identification document prompt experience

**Notice:**
If you are upgrading from an older version, you need to configure the newly added text In the Portal's UI Configuration page.
![img_1.png](img_1.png)
If the configuration for the newly added texts, namely "zdoc_msg_too_dark", "zdoc_msg_too_bright", and "zdoc_msg_abrasion", is not available,
the corresponding English texts will be displayed by default. This may cause inconsistency with the set language.
I would recommend re-importing from In the Portal's UI Configuration page and configuring these new texts. Once you have made the necessary configurations, you can export the file again.

## Version 1.3.1.230925144644
+ Fix some bugs.
+ Improve face detection capabilities
+ Add new feature for doc detection by NFC

## Version 1.3.0.230907171559
+ Fix some bugs.

**Notice:**

If other SDKs are integrated at the same time, and you run into issue "More than one file was found with OS independent path 'lib/arm64-v8a/libc++_shared.so'".
The main reason is that the ZOLOZ SDK and other SDKs add the libc++_shared.so library. The solution is to add the following configuration in the build.gradle.

```groovy
  packagingOptions {
    pickFirst 'lib/arm64-v8a/libc++_shared.so'
    pickFirst 'lib/armeabi-v7a/libc++_shared.so'
  }
```
